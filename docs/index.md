# ElectionGuard in the November 2022 General Election

Some voters in the 2022 November General Election will experience ElectionGuard for the first time.  In those districts, voters will be able to use a confirmation code to see for themselves that their ballot was counted.  Others may choose to run a BallotCheck. 

In addition, other vendors contributed services and capabilities to showcase how independent verification of elections work. Hart InterCivic has integrated ElectionGuard into its Verity precinct scanners; MITRE wrote an independent verifier; and Enhanced Voting is provided the confirmation code lookup service.
