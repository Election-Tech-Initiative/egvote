## Overview

Voters in College Park, Maryland will experience ElectionGuard for the first time in the November 2023 General Election.  They will have the option to fill out their ballots by hand or use the Hart Verity TouchWriter.

After filling out their ballot, in-person voters will then scan the ballot using the Hart Verity Scanner. The scanner first prints the ElectionGuard confirmation code and then presents voters with an onscreen summary of the choices it interprets.

After viewing the summary, the voter can then submit (or cast) their ballot or, if they want to run a BallotCheck, they can cancel the ballot from being cast. In that case, the Verity scanner returns the ballot and the voter engages the poll worker to record the challenge and get a new ballot to vote again. In either case the confirmation code is used to check the result: for cast ballots, the voter sees whether the ballot was included in the final tally; for BallotCheck ballots, the voter can see the choices captured by the scanner. BallotCheck ballots are not included in any tallies.

Several partners contributed services and capabilities to showcase how independent verification of elections work. Hart InterCivic has integrated ElectionGuard into its Verity precinct scanners; MITRE wrote an independent verifier; and Enhanced Voting provided the confirmation code lookup service.
